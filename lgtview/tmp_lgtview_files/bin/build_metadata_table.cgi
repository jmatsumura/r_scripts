build_metadata_table.cgi

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Script to build a metadata table for the intermediary site of LGTView.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script takes a single argument: 

- A file that contains the directory paths which house the relevant output files 
from LGTSeek. For each directory provided, this script will then access the 
respective metadata file, the BLASTN raw results file, and the respective LGT
out results file. If multiple directories are present then these BLAST results
must be merged as well as providing the metadata fields which actually have 
a value assigned to them for at least one group. 

The primary purpose of this script is to populate the generateLGTView.html site 
with a table that users can interact with to generate their custom instance
of LGTView.
